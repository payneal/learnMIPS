Question #1:
Say that a processor has a full set of bit manipulation instructions. Can it do arithmetic with these instructions? 
Yes

Question #2: 
The MIPS addu instruction performs the Binary Addition Algorithm on two 32-bit patterns. What integer representation method can be used with it?
Both

Question #3: 
Use the Binary Addition Algorithm on these 8-bit patterns:

 1010 1011
 0101 0101
———————————
      
Does overflow happen for:

Unsigned Binary? Yes
Two's Complement? No

Question #4: 
What is the range of integers that can be represented with 32-bit two's complement?

-2^? to +2^_ -1

(Pick an exponent for wach "2")
31

Question #5: 
Are registers $9 and $8 changed by the addu instruction in this program?

no just $10

Question $6
(Review:) Can a negative const be used with the instruction:
ori $d, $0, const
No

Question 7:
 
Say that register $8 has been loaded with +82 by using:
    ori  $8,$0,82
What instructions can do the following:
    Reflect the bits in $8
    Add one to $8

addu , nor
