    ## Question #1 â€” To Lower Case
    
    ## Write a program that converts the string to all lower case characters. Do this by adding 0x20 to each character in the string. (See Appendix F to figure out why this works.)

    ## Assume that the data consists only of upper-case alphabetical characters, with no spaces or punctuation.
            
        ## A = 0x41, a = 0x61
        ## B = 0x42 ,b = 0x62
        ## C = 0x43, c = 0x63
        ## D = 0x44, d = 0x64
        ## E = 0x45, e = 0x65
        ## F = 0x46, f = 0x66
        ## G = 0x47, d = 0x67
        
        #lui     $9, 0x1000                  # point at first char

    ## while not ch == null do
    #loop: 
        #lbu     $10 , 0($9)                 # get char to reg $10
        #sll     $0, $0, 0                   # branch delay

        #beq     $10, $0, done               # exit loop if char == null
        #sll     $0, $0, 0                   # branch delay

        #addiu   $10, $10, 0x20              # add 0x20 to make lower case
        
        #sb      $10, 0($9)                  # saved changed value
        #sll     $0, $0, 0                   # branch delay 

        #addiu   $9, $9, 1                   # point at the next char

    #done:
        ## string should be all lower case
        #sll     $0, $0, 0                   # branch delay
       
        
        ## prove you changed the string
        #lui     $8 , 0x1000                  # POINT AGAIN TO FIRST CHAR 
        #lbu     $9 , 0($8)                   # load into reg $9 (prove A => a

    ## Write a program that capitalizes the first letter of each word, so that after running your program the data will look like this:

    ## Question #7
  
    #Declare an array of integers in the usual way:

            #.data
    #size :  .word 7                     # number of elements
    #        .word 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
    #Write a program that reverses the order of elements in the array. The result will be as if the array were declared:

            #.data
    #size :  .word 7                     # number of elements
    #       .word 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
    #Test that the program works on arrays of several lengths, both even and odd lengths.


        lui    $9, 0x1000                   # set array pointer 
        lw     $10, 0($9)                   # $10 = size of array

        sll    $0, $0, 0                        # branch delay
        
        ori    $1, $0, 2                    # set $1 to 2 for division
        div    $10, $2                      # div size/2
         
        mflo   $1                           
        mfhi   $2
        

       
          
        .data
