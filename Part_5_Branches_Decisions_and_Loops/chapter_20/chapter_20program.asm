    ## Question #1 â€” To Lower Case
    
    ## Write a program that converts the string to all lower case characters. Do this by adding 0x20 to each character in the string. (See Appendix F to figure out why this works.)

    ## Assume that the data consists only of upper-case alphabetical characters, with no spaces or punctuation.
            
        ## A = 0x41, a = 0x61
        ## B = 0x42 ,b = 0x62
        ## C = 0x43, c = 0x63
        ## D = 0x44, d = 0x64
        ## E = 0x45, e = 0x65
        ## F = 0x46, f = 0x66
        ## G = 0x47, d = 0x67
        
        #lui     $9, 0x1000                  # point at first char

    ## while not ch == null do
    #loop: 
        #lbu     $10 , 0($9)                 # get char to reg $10
        #sll     $0, $0, 0                   # branch delay

        #beq     $10, $0, done               # exit loop if char == null
        #sll     $0, $0, 0                   # branch delay

        #addiu   $10, $10, 0x20              # add 0x20 to make lower case
        
        #sb      $10, 0($9)                  # saved changed value
        #sll     $0, $0, 0                   # branch delay 

        #addiu   $9, $9, 1                   # point at the next char

        #j       loop                        # jump to  loop again
        #sll     $0, $0, 0                   # branch delay

    #done:
        ## string should be all lower case
        #sll     $0, $0, 0                   # branch delay
       
        
        ## prove you changed the string
        #lui     $8 , 0x1000                  # POINT AGAIN TO FIRST CHAR 
        #lbu     $9 , 0($8)                   # load into reg $9 (prove A => a 
        ## check that hex = 6# 1-7
        #sll     $0, $0, 0 
        #lbu     $9 , 4($8)                  # load reg $9 (prove D => d 
        #sll     $0, $0, 0         
        #sll     $0, $0, 0        

        #.data
#string: .asciiz "ABCDEFG"                   # word #1 is working on
    
    ## Question #2 -
    
    ## Write a program that capitalizes the first letter of each word, so that after running your program the data will look like this:
