Question #7
Fill in the blanks with BASE SIXTEEN digits

31A (base sixteen) = __ × sixteen^2 + ___ × sixteen^1 + __ × sixteen^0
3 , 1, 10(A)

Question #8 
More practice:   What integer is represented by 1B2 (base sixteen) ?
1B2 =  __ × sixteen^2 + __ × sixteen^1 + __ × sixteen^0
1B2 =  __(base 10) × 16^2 + __(base 10) × 16^1 + __(base 10) × 16^0
1B2 = __(base 10) * __(base 10) + __(base 10) * __(base 10) + __(base 10) * __(base 10)
1B2 = __(base 10)

line 1 = 1, b, 2 
line 2 = 1, 11, 2
line 3 = 1, 256, 11, 16, 2, 1
line 4 = 434

Question #9

-Familiar binary integers
be familiar with binary patterns 
ex 1000 0000 = 128 
   0111 1111 = 127 

-Shifting left a binary pattern
Useful Fact: If the number N is represented by a bit pattern X, then X0 represents 2N.

If 00110010 represents 5010 , then 001100100 represents 10010. Often you need the "shifted" pattern to have the same number of bits as the original pattern. Doing this with eight bits, 01100100 represents 10010.

This is called "shifting left" by one bit. It is often used in hardware to multiply by two. If you must keep the same number of bits (as is usually true for computer hardware) then make sure that no "1" bits are lost on the left.

-Unsigned binary representation
no negative numbers are represented

-Hexadecimal representation
0-15 where a = 10, ..... f = 15

-Shifting left a hexadecimal pattern
Adding a 0 to the end of an integer written in base sixteen multiplies the integer by sixteen. To multiply an integer by sixteenN, add N zeros on the right:

-Equivalence of hexadecimal strings and bit pattern names
The name of the binary pattern 1010 is "A". The hex digit that corresponds to the number represented by 10102 is also "A".

It is OK to have a pattern that has the name "A" and also to use "A" as a digit.

When a 4-bit pattern represents a number in base two, that number represented in hex is the same digit as the bit pattern name.

-Converting representations, between base 16 and base 2
It is easy to convert between base sixteen and base two representation:

(In base two) Shifting left by four bits is equivalent to multiplication by sixteen.
(In base hex) Shifting left by one digit is equivalent to multiplication by sixteen.

-Converting a decimal representation to any base
You already know how to convert from Base B to Decimal. The algorithm converts number from decimal to base B representation.

div means integer division and mod means modulo.

number div B is how many times B goes into number.

number mod B is the left-over amount.

For example, 15 div 6 = 2 and 15 mod 6 = 3.

Here is an example: convert 5410 to hex representation. The base is 16. The first execution of the loop body calculates digit[0] the right-most digit of the hex number.
