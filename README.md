## Programmed Introduction to MIPS Assembly Language
## Central Connecticut State University

## QtSpim Edition, August 2015

This is a course in assembly language programming of the MIPS processor. It emphasizes the topics needed for study of computer architecture: bits, bit patterns, operations on bit patterns, and how bit patterns represent instructions and data. This course is equivalent to a semester-long junior college or university course (except, perhaps, for the emphasis on bit patterns).

The emphasis of the course is on understanding how computers work. This will provide a basis for further study of computer architecture and computer software. The MIPS processor, the subject of this course, has a well designed architecture and is particularly fruitful to study. However, the goal of the course is not to turn you into a MIPS programmer, but to give you an understanding of all computer systems.

The only equipment you need for this course is a PC. The only software you need is the SPIM simulator of the MIPS32 processor and a text editor. The simulator is available by free download (see appendix A). Example programs are presented using an MS Windows operating system. However, you can use any platform that runs SPIM. (There are many).

Assembly Language is normally taken the semester after a course in a high level programming language (such as Java or C). This course assumes that you have this background although no specific programming language is required.

Read the pages of this course actively. Think about and answer the question at the bottom of each page. (This style of tutorial is called programmed learning. It is very effective for technical material). Most questions call for just a little thought. Some call for pencil and paper. Keep a pencil and a scrap of paper next to your keyboard. Each chapter is about 15 pages long. Spend several minutes per page. You can read each chapter in about 30 minutes. However, for maximum benefit, you should run some of the example programs, write some programs of your own, and then think about your results. This may take several hours.
