Question #1
How many patterns can be formed with a single bit? (Hint: click on the switch!)
2

Question #2
Is the pattern 0 1 different from the pattern 1 0?
yes

Question#3
Is the number of patterns that can be formed with N bits greater than the number of bits?
Yes 

Question#4
How many patterns can be formed from three bits?
8 

Question #5
How many patterns can be formed from N bits?
2^N

(Twice the number of patterns that can be formed from (N-1) bits.)

Question #6 
In the past, some computers used 16 bits to form memory addresses. Assuming no special tricks (which such limited machines often used), how many bytes maximum could be held in main storage?
2^16

Question #7 
You wish to save a GIF image using either 6 bits per pixel or 8 bits per pixel. Saving the image with 8 bits per pixel takes somewhat more memory. Which should you choose?

Use 8 unless memory is the most important deciding factor

Question #8 
Name the following patterns:

0001 0001 -> 11    
0011 1001 -> 39
1011 1111 -> BF  
0100 0110 -> 46   
0000 0000 -> 00  

Question #9 
Name the following patterns; include 0x in the name:

0000 1010 0001 0001 -> 0A11    
0001 0010 1001 1010 -> 129A   
1111 1010 1101 1110 -> fade  
0011 0110 1100 0000 -> 36C0  
0000 0000 0000 0000 -> 0000

Question #10
What is the OCTAL pattern name of the following bit patterns:

111 010 001 -> 0721    
100 011 010 -> 0432  
011011110   -> 0335
11000000    -> 0300

key terms: 

Byte 
In most computer documentation, 8 contiguous bits are called a byte

Listing bit patterns
There is a standard method for listing all of the patterns that can be formed with a given number of bits. First, list all of the patterns that can be formed with one bit:
To increase the number of bits (from one to two) make two copies of the list
Within each copy, each row is unique. Now, make each row in the combined list unique. Do this by putting a "0" in front of each line of the first copy, and a "1" in front of each line of the second copy:

Number of patterns with N bits
2^n 

kilobyte
1024 bytes is called a kilobyte, abbreviated K and pronounced "Kay".

multiplying powers
2^(N+M) = 2^n*2^M

nibble names
it is convenient to break bit patterns into 4-bit groups (called nibbles):
Bits are grouped into nibbles starting at the right. Then each nibble is named. This method of giving names to patterns is called hexadecimal

hexadecimal 
0000 - 1111 
0    -  F

Octal
000 - 111
0   -  7
